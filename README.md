EDA is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems such as Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and Integrated Circuits (ICs). These tools help designers to manage the complexity of the PCB designs and verify them. When designing PCBs, the distance between two elements should be greater than a threshold to avoid some side effects such as crosstalk and overheating. For measuring that distance, some methods such as finding the shortest path between components in a PCB design are employed. The invention presents a solution for finding the shortest path among components in a PCB layout. Besides, it can be a considered solution for the circuit routing problem.
